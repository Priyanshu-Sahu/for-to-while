# For Loop to While Loop conversion C/C++

## Syntax of for loop

    for(initialization; condition; operation){
        /*code*/
    }

## Syntax of while loop

    while(condition){
        /*code*/
    }

### Conversion of for loop into while loop

    initialization;
    while(condition){
        /*code*/
        operation;
    }

## Note
Demonstration of the same is shown using printing the diamond-star pattern using for and while loop in c++ in this repository.
